# Getting Started with React Components & React Hooks

You can try my budget contol app (here) []

This is the very first project when I used Redux Toolkit.
This app allow to add expenses and incomes, count your balance and transfer money to savings. Expenses and transer options are protected from spending more money that you have on balance.
Through this, I learned Redux Toolkit and improved my knowledges in Typescript and React also it is first time when I used pagination feature. My prior knowledge on this technologies helped significantly and I had possibility to use new hooks.The biggest takeaway from this project is combining React with Redux and creating reducers. They made my code much more easier to write and understand. During work on this project I had a lot of interesting researches that helped me to improve my knowledges.
